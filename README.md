# QuantumHPC

Distributed Research Experience for Undergraduates (DREU) research project investigating scalable quantum simulation, high-performance computing (HPC), and quantum machine learning workflows for clinical text deidentification.

---

# Overview

QuantumHPC is a collaborative research project exploring how quantum computing and HPC technologies can be combined to support scalable quantum machine learning research.

The project focuses on:

- Manual quantum circuit construction using Qiskit
- Quantum circuit simulation with Qiskit Aer
- High-performance benchmarking
- Distributed execution using MPI
- Performance evaluation across HPC resources such as Jetstream2 and Bridges-2
- Future applications in clinical text deidentification
- *To be updated with Edmund & Sofia's work*

---

# Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Develop manually constructed parameterized quantum circuits without relying on high-level feature map libraries.
- Benchmark quantum simulations across CPU and GPU architectures.
- Investigate distributed quantum simulation using MPI.
- Evaluate scalability on HPC systems.
- Build a reproducible research workflow through version control and documentation.
- *To be updated with Edmund & Sofia's work*
